A responsive website ensures that potential guests can easily navigate and view content, make bookings, and engage with the site, regardless of their device.</li>
            <li className={style.container2_div1_li}><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong>A user-friendly interface focuses on designing a website that is intuitive and easy to navigate.

Hotels and resorts can increase direct bookings and reduce dependency on online travel agencies by offering a convenient and integrated booking process.</li>
            <li className={style.container2_div1_li}><strong>Engaging Visuals:</strong>Engaging visuals, including high-quality images and videos, capture potential guests' attention and convey the property's unique features and ambiance.
