        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h3>Identify and Integrate Relevant Keywords</h3>
          <p>Keywords play a crucial role in SEO as they help search engines understand the content of your website.

        </div>
        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h3>Diversify Your Content Formats</h3>

          <h3>Focus on Evergreen Content</h3>
          <p>To ensure long-term results, focus on creating evergreen content that remains relevant over time.

        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h3>Create and Follow a Content Calendar</h3>

        </div>
        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h2>Google Business Profile: Driving Local Leads</h2>
          <p>Local search is essential for audiologists as potential patients often look for practices in their area. Claiming and optimizing your Google Business Profile listing can significantly improve your visibility in local search results.</p>
          <p>Consider the following tips to optimize your Google Business Profile:</p>
        </div>
        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h3>Verify and Update NAP Information</h3>
          <p>Start by verifying your name, address, and phone number (NAP) details on your Google Business Profile. Ensure that the information is accurate and up to date, as this will help potential patients find and contact your practice easily.</p>
        </div>
        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h3>Add a Compelling Blurb about Your Practice</h3>
          <p>Craft a short and engaging blurb that provides an overview of your practice and the services you offer. Use this opportunity to highlight your expertise and unique selling points, giving potential patients a compelling reason to choose your practice.</p>
        </div>
        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h3>Include Hours of Operation and Photos</h3>
          <p>Make sure to include your practice's hours of operation on your Google Business Profile. This information helps potential patients know when they can contact your practice and book appointments.<br />Additionally, adding high-quality photos of your practice, staff, and products like hearing aids can significantly enhance your profile's performance. Visual content attracts more clicks and engages potential patients.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Focus on Long-Tail Keywords</h3>
          <p>Targeting long-tail keywords can be cost-effective and help you reach a more specific audience. Long-tail keywords consist of three or more words and often have higher conversion rates compared to broader terms.</p>
        </div>
        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h3>Utilize Ad Extensions</h3>
          <p>Ad extensions allow you to provide additional information and improve the performance of your ads. Experiment with various ad extensions, such as sitelink extensions and call extensions, to enhance the visibility and effectiveness of your PPC campaigns.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Create Custom Landing Pages</h3>
          <p>When users click on your ads, make sure to direct them to relevant and customized landing pages. A well-designed landing page that focuses on the specific audiology service you're advertising can significantly increase conversions and maximize the impact of your PPC campaigns.</p>
        </div>
        <div className={style.container2_div1}>
          <h3>Continually Optimize Your Bids</h3>
          <p>Regularly monitor and adjust your bid amounts to optimize your PPC campaigns. By analyzing the performance of your ads and making data-driven bid adjustments, you can maximize your budget and achieve better results.</p>
